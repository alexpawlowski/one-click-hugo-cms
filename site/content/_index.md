    During 28 caffeine-filled, sleepless hours, members from the Greater
    Knoxville community will brainstorm, build, break, test, and deploy whatever
    they can imagine, for the chance to win amazing prizes totaling over $6,400.


    There will also be plenty of time to interact with professional mentors and
    engineers, meet recruiters, and listen to great tech talks and tutorials
    from sponsors.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

    During 28 caffeine-filled, sleepless hours, members from the Greater
    Knoxville community will brainstorm, build, break, test, and deploy whatever
    they can imagine, for the chance to win amazing prizes totaling over $6,400.


    There will also be plenty of time to interact with professional mentors and
    engineers, meet recruiters, and listen to great tech talks and tutorials
    from sponsors.

<h2 class="f2 b lh-title mb2">What We Offer</h2>

KnxHx is a great opportunity for you to connect with the Knoxville software
community and the City. Your financial support will help to fund this event
and enrich civic minded projects to succeed.

We connect the local software community to great projects to serve fellow citizens in Knoxville. Take a look at the tiers of support that we have and choose the one that most closely fits your needs. Our sponsors last year got great feedback from the attendees, and we hope to deliver the same this year. Participants, only your email and your name are shared with our sponsors. Any subsequent marketing efforts will allow you to opt-out.

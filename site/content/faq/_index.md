  - heading: What is a hackathon?
    text: >
      A hackathon is a marathon of innovation, usually 24-36 hours in which
      participants passionate about creating concepts and technology form teams
      and compete with other teams to generate, develop and/or implement a new
      idea from scratch in order to learn and have fun.

  - heading: Is this in-person?
    text: >
      It's not! Thanks to the Remo platform and local virtual experience experts
      [Lunchpool](https://www.remo.co/?fpr=lunchpool), we will be hosting this
      hackathon virtually. Due to the indoors nature of a traditional hackathon
      with 100s of participants in close proximity, we chose not to pursue an
      in-person format due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As East TN heads to
      Phase 3 by the time of the hackathon, we will have a limited number of
      organizers on-site physically together to ensure that we can diagnose any
      potential problems that arise for the weekend / provide support for our
      participants; but 100+ events indoors are still not the best idea.

  - heading: How much does it cost?
    text: >
      $10. For $10, we will provide you with a t-shirt (mailing details TBD) and
      the opportunity to apply your skills to win prizes. You just need to sign
      up and log-in during the event!

  - heading: Who can come?
    text: >
      Any participants ages 18 and up of Knoxville and the surrounding counties
      are more than welcome to register and virtually attend. Since it's
      virtual, anyone 18+ can participate, but keep in mind that the projects
      will be dealing with Knoxville specifically. If that's no problem, come on
      and join us!

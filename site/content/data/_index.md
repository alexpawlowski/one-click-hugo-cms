Below are the data challenges for the weekend:

## Shared Micromobility and Infrastructure
_In Partnership with University of Tennessee Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering_

[Download Scooter Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PkAVDCjlFxFyYoW4HeNh-nRnncbIQLJm/view?usp=sharing)

The City of Knoxville entered agreements with two shared e-scooter companies in spring 2019 to provide shared scooter services. One of the companies, VeoRide, provided access to a sample of their ride anonymized ride data. The data includes about 19,000 trips. Attributes of the trips include GPS coordinates of the start of the trip and the end of the trip, with timestamps, as well as “bread crumb” GPS points along the route.


Non- and semi-motorized modes are notoriously hard to monitor so it is difficult to identify where to prioritize infrastructure. Shared micromobility provides rich data streams to begin to shed light on operations, management, safety, and sustainability implications of these modes. From this dataset, you should be able to highlight high priority flows along the street network. Can you identify algorithms to label utilitarian trips (e.g., shopping or commuting) with recreational trips (e.g., joyrides)? What parts of the city do riders most frequently travel between? What types of infrastructure do scooter riders use (or avoid) and can the data give insights into where we should build better infrastructure to make scooters and other micro-vehicles more attractive and safe. Can we organize parking in ways to improve pedestrian infrastructure and reduce sidewalk clutter? 


The Data. The dataset is a JSON file structure extracted from Veo’s ride database. It is a 10-20% sample of all rides. that includes unique identifiers for individual trips, trip origin and destination and intermediate coordinates of the trip, and time/date stamps. The data can also be overlaid on Open Street Map data for the City of Knoxville. 

## COVID-19

Our Data provider MTNA has provided data on https://knxhx.richdataservices.com/ related to COVID-19 in the Knox County area, as well as for Tennessee. The visuals we have seen on [Knox County Health Dept](https://covid.knoxcountytn.gov/case-count.html) reinforce the on-going trends with the case count on the ground. Is there additional context that could be provided? As COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, we and across the nation have seen elevated case counts for minority groups. The U.S. Census provides a snapshot of the makeup of different communities across many different variables, is there a way to connect this available data with that of COVID-19? The [TN State Data Center](https://tnsdc.utk.edu/) provides many census related data specific to Tennessee, their [data](https://myutk.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=c98fc99308dd43fb98146d3cf21fc31c&view=list&start=1&num=20&showFilters=true&sortOrder=desc&sortField=modified#content) may be useful to connect with

## City Data Challenges

In addition to the data provided on https://knxhx.richdataservices.com/, the [Office of Neighborhoods](https://knoxvilletn.gov/government/city_departments_offices/neighborhoods) is also looking for a group to help with a database creation. In addition to the criteria below, is there a way to have a public facing side, that shows the neighborhood boundaries, with context to the City Council Districts and the top contact for the association (Name, Email) as well as the Neighborhood Email. You can see what this currently looks like: [neighborhood directory](https://knoxvilletn.gov/government/city_departments_offices/neighborhoods/neighborhood_directory) Here is an entire list of the neighborhoods within city boundaries, [neighborhood index](https://knoxvilletn.gov/government/city_departments_offices/neighborhoods/neighborhood_directory/neighborhoods_by_knoxville-knox_county_planning)

- Neighborhood Name
- Neighborhood type (neighborhood org., HOA, Start up, Neighborhood Watch)
- Active or Non-Active
- Neighborhood Email
- Neighborhood Address
- Neighborhood Phone
- Neighborhood City Council District
- Neighborhood Boundaries \
  - North
  - South
  - East
  - West
- Meetings (i.e. Third Thursday of every other month - odd months)
  - Day of the Week
  - Week of the Month
  - Monthly/Bi Monthly/Quarterly/Annually
  - Location of meeting   
  - Time of meeting
- Neighborhood Website
- Neighborhood Facebook page
- Date last updated
- Notes

Under Neighborhood Name we would like a drop down box to add people to the group, including these boxes:
- First Name 
- Last Name
- Position Held in Neighborhood Org.
- Contact for the Neighborhood or No
- Email
- Phone
- Address 1
- Address 2
- City State 
- Zip Code
- Mail Newsletter or No

We want to be able look people up by name or by neighborhood.  

We want to be able to sort by City Council District, Neighborhood Type, Active/Non-Active, and Meeting nights. We would want to pull out all the people that want to have a newsletter mailed to their home address, including the full addresses.
